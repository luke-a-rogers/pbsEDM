Workflow. Both pushing to same repo, so always check on GitHub first, then (if necessary)
```
git fetch
git rebase
```

If get conflicts then see some notes at https://github.com/pacific-hake/hake-assessment (for which we are also pushing to a single repository), scroll down to the GitHub workflow section.
