The tibble `Nx_lags_orig` is saved in the package and contains a simple time
series $N(t)$ as `Nt`, the lagged value $N(t-1)$ as `Ntmin1`, and first difference
$X(t) = N(t+1) - N(t)$ as `Xt` (and `Xtmin1` and `Xtmin2` the lagged values),
with EDM results for embedding dimension 2, using `rEDM` and Andy's original
function `EDM_pred_E_2()`. See `?Nx_lags_orig` for full details.

TODO: change all this to use the above....

<!-- based on `mwe-2019.r` and two GitHub issues
 expect_equal(Nx_lags_orig$rEDM.pred, rEDM_points$pred)    is TRUE, so no longer
 need rEDM_points
-->

The issue is that `rEDM` seems to use $\bf{x}(t^*+2)$ as a nearest neighbour, using the
Deyle et al. (2013) notation that $\bf{x}$ is the vector of lagged values of the
scalars $X(t)$, where time $t = 1, 2, 3, ..., 99$ in this case, i.e.

$$\bf{x}(t) = (X(t), X(t-1)).$$

For $t^*=94$, Andy's earlier R code calculates nearest neighbours with indices $\psi$
(using $\psi$ instead of the $t$ with a line through in Deyle et al. 2013),
which for $t^*=94$ gives `psivec94` and corresponding weights `weights94`:
```{r psi}
psivec94 = c(6, 57, 88)
weights94 = c(0.3678794, 0.3205861, 0.2895013)
```
giving the estimate of $X(95)$, from [S1] of Deyle et al. (2013), as
```{r Xninetyfive}
X95est = sum(weights94 * simple_ts[psivec94+1]) / sum(weights94)
X95est
```

(That code isn't in a package and isn't really functionalised, so when we have
Luke's functionalised code run the same calculations with his code to hopefully
get the same results TODO.)

However, `rEDM` gives
```{r rEDMninetyfive}
X95est_rEDM = rEDM_points[95, "pred"]
X95est_rEDM
```

But we can reproduce the `rEDM` result in the manual code by allowing
$\bf{x}(96)$ to be a nearest neighbour of $\bf{x}(94)$,  giving
```{r psi94allow}
psivec94_allow = c(96, 6, 57)   # so 6 and 57 are now 2nd and 3rd nearest neighbours
weights94_allow = c(3.678794e-01, 1.405278e-04, 4.146457e-05)
# Note that the first weight is the same as above (by definition it's always
#  exp(-1)), but the second and third are very small because x[96] is
#  very close to x[94].
X95est_allow = sum(weights94_allow * simple_ts[psivec94_allow+1]) /
               sum(weights94_allow)
X95est_allow
```

However, the issue is that we should not be allowed to use $\bf{x}(96)$.
By definition,
$$\bf{x}(96) = (X(96), X(95)),$$
which contains $X(95)$. But $X(95)$ is one of the components of
$$\bf{x}(95) = (X(95), X(94))$$
which is what we are trying to forecast from $\bf{x}(94)$.
$X(95)$ is presumably the 'one' that we are leaving out in 'leave-one-out', but
it occurs in $\bf{x}(95)$ and $\bf{x}(96)$, by definition.

So $\bf{x}(96)$ should not be used to forecast $\bf{x}(95)$, because it
explicitly contains one of the two components of $\bf{x}(95)$.

The Same issue occurs (with Andy's old code) for $t^*=75$.

## Another attempt with `rEDM`

Had tried this in `rEDM`, to not allow $X(96)$ to be a nearest neighbour
predicting $X(95)$ from $X(94)$ -- think this isn't possible, since still kind of
want cross-validation. Had played with `lib` and `pred` but couldn't get answer
to agree with Andy's original one (may be off with the index by 1). Not running
this in vignette:
```{r rEDMagain, eval=FALSE}
simp_Efix2 = simplex(simple_ts,
                     E = 2,
                     stats_only = FALSE,
                     # lib = matrix(c(1, 94, 97, 99), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE),
                     lib = c(1, 94),
                     pred = c(95, 97)
                     # pred = matrix(c(95, 95, 96, 96), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
                     )
rEDM_points2 = simp_Efix2[,"model_output"][[1]]       # time, obs, pred and pred_var
# Make each row correspond to t:
# rEDM_points2 = rbind(c(1, simple_ts[1], NA, NA), rEDM_points2) - only if doing all times
head(rEDM_points2)
```
