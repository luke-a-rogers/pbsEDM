The tibble `Nx_lags_orig` is saved in the package and contains a simple time
series $N(t)$ as `Nt`, the lagged value $N(t-1)$ as `Ntmin1`, and first difference
$X(t) = N(t+1) - N(t)$ as `Xt` (and `Xtmin1` and `Xtmin2` the lagged values),
with EDM results for embedding dimension 2, using `rEDM` and Andy's original
function `EDM_pred_E_2()`. See `?Nx_lags_orig` for full details.

Here are the full results (for helping explain some of the later text):
```{r fullresults}
as.data.frame(Nx_lags_orig)
```

Plot of data (before making movie):
```{r}
plotPanelMovie.df2(only.final.plot=TRUE,
                   open.pdf=FALSE)
```

Movie:

To plot the data in various ways, and show it evolving through time use this
code, which is commented out since it causes Travis
to fail (Travis is the continuous integration service that automatically
checks the package builds every time a change is committed to GitHub).
The trick to showing the movie is to run the code uncommented (you need to
install the `gifski` package), right-click on the animation in the
html viewer and save it. I've done that and so am leaving this code commented,
and will just refer to the saved animation file. TODO:  not saved yet since big.

The final panel shows the predicted vs observed from rEDM and from Andy's manual
calculations. For now this shows how good the predictions are, but highlights
one obvious discrepancy, to be looked into further below.
```{r, animation.hook = 'gifski', interval = 1.5}
# Cannot change fig.width and fig.height hooks unless re-order par() in function
# fig.width is 0.67 * fig.height
#```{r, eval=FALSE}
 for(i in 1:nrow(Nx_lags_orig))
  {
    plotPanelMovie.df2(end = i,
                       max_time = max(Nx_lags_orig$t),
                       only.final.plot=TRUE,
                       open.pdf=FALSE)
  }
# ```
```

See the bottom of
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrew-edwards/sizeSpectra/master/doc/MEPS_IBTS_recommend.html
for making a movie in latex in an .rnw file, though can probably use the tricks
above to save .Rmd as .pdf.

Plot Andy's manual predictions against rEDM predictions:
```{r}
eps = 0.00001      # How different the predictions can be
plot(Nx_lags_orig$rEDM.pred,
     Nx_lags_orig$my.pred,
     xlab = "rEDM predictions",
     ylab = "Andy predictions")
abline(a=0,
       b=1,
       col="grey")
# Colour in red the ones more than eps away
different <- dplyr::filter(Nx_lags_orig,
              abs(pred.diff) > eps)
points(different$rEDM.pred,
       different$my.pred,
       col = "red",
       pch = 20)

```

This shows that three points disagree between Andy's calculations and
rEDM's by more than `r eps`. (Originally I had another few but they are now
corrected in rEDM so can be ignored). The points are
```{r}
different
```

Use new pbsEDM code and compare with rEDM's and then Andy's:
```{r pbsEDMcalc}

# ----------------- Begin: Replaced pbs_simplex_1 by newer pbs_edm LR ---------#

# pbs_calc <- pbs_simplex_1(Nx_lags_orig,
#                           col_name = "Xt")
# testthat::expect_equal(Nx_lags_orig$Xt,
#                        pbs_calc$pred_tbl$obs$Xt)

pbs_calc <- pbs_edm(Nx_lags_orig,
                    lags = list(Xt = c(0:1))) # Now calls updated function LR

testthat::expect_equal(Nx_lags_orig$Xt,
                       pbs_calc$observations$observations) # check the indexing is the same

# pbs_pred <- pbs_calc$pred_tbl$pred
pbs_pred <- pbs_calc$forecasts$forecasts # Now calls updated function LR

# ----------------- End: Replaced pbs_simplex_1 by newer pbs_edm LR -----------#

plot(Nx_lags_orig$rEDM.pred,
     pbs_pred,
     xlab = "rEDM predictions",
     ylab = "pbsEDM predictions")
abline(a=0,
       b=1,
       col="grey")
# Colour in red the ones more than eps away
# different <- dplyr::filter(Nx_lags_orig,
#              abs(pred.diff) > eps)
#points(different$rEDM.pred,
#       different$my.pred,
#       col = "red",
#       pch = 20)
```

Looks promising. Then compare pbsEDM with Andy's:
```{r}
plot(Nx_lags_orig$my.pred,
     pbs_pred,
     xlab = "Andy predictions",
     ylab = "pbsEDM predictions")
abline(a=0,
       b=1,
       col="grey")
max(abs(Nx_lags_orig$my.pred - pbs_pred), na.rm = TRUE)
```

Conclusion: Andy's original manual calculations and Luke's new function in
pbsEDM give the
same answer for this simulated data set, which differs in three places from
rEDM's. Our code was written independently (though Andy did explain the issue he
had found out). This is a reassuring test of Luke's new code (which is more
general than Andy's as can do more than just E=2).

Another check is this (first line produces an error so I've commented it out,
but that alerts us to an NA difference in the final value ):

```{r}
# testthat::expect_equal(Nx_lags_orig$my.pred, pbs_pred)     # output is:
#     Error: Nx_lags_orig$my.pred not equal to `pbs_pred`.
#     3/100 mismatches (average diff: NaN)
#     [17] -0.0645 - NA == NA
#     [29] -0.1021 - NA == NA
#     [45] -0.0937 - NA == NA
inds <- setdiff(1:100, c(17, 29, 45))
testthat::expect_equal(Nx_lags_orig$my.pred[inds], pbs_pred[inds])   # This passes LR

Nx_lags_orig$my.pred[c(17, 29, 45)]
pbs_pred[c(17, 29, 45)] # All NAs
length(pbs_pred)
```
So `pbs_pred` gives NA values for the three time steps. Presumably it should
make a prediction since it has all the required data. TODO look into with Luke.


GOT TO HERE. Next maybe continue with
sockeye-sim-edm, maybe starting a new vignette to compare rEDM's and Luke's in
detail for different values of E. Keep this one for visualising the data and
understanding.





TODO: change all this to use the above....

<!-- based on `mwe-2019.r` and two GitHub issues
 expect_equal(Nx_lags_orig$rEDM.pred, rEDM_points$pred)    is TRUE, so no longer
 need rEDM_points
-->

The issue is that `rEDM` seems to use $\bf{x}(t^*+2)$ as a nearest neighbour, using the
Deyle et al. (2013) notation that $\bf{x}$ is the vector of lagged values of the
scalars $X(t)$, where time $t = 1, 2, 3, ..., 99$ in this case, i.e.

$$\bf{x}(t) = (X(t), X(t-1)).$$

For $t^*=94$, Andy's earlier R code calculates nearest neighbours with indices $\psi$
(using $\psi$ instead of the $t$ with a line through in Deyle et al. 2013),
which for $t^*=94$ gives `psivec94` and corresponding weights `weights94`:
```{r psi}
psivec94 = c(6, 57, 88)
weights94 = c(0.3678794, 0.3205861, 0.2895013)
```
giving the estimate of $X(95)$, from [S1] of Deyle et al. (2013), as
```{r Xninetyfive}
X95est = sum(weights94 * simple_ts[psivec94+1]) / sum(weights94)
X95est
```

(That code isn't in a package and isn't really functionalised, so when we have
Luke's functionalised code run the same calculations with his code to hopefully
get the same results TODO.)

However, `rEDM` gives
```{r rEDMninetyfive}
X95est_rEDM = rEDM_points[95, "pred"]
X95est_rEDM
```

But we can reproduce the `rEDM` result in the manual code by allowing
$\bf{x}(96)$ to be a nearest neighbour of $\bf{x}(94)$,  giving
```{r psi94allow}
psivec94_allow = c(96, 6, 57)   # so 6 and 57 are now 2nd and 3rd nearest neighbours
weights94_allow = c(3.678794e-01, 1.405278e-04, 4.146457e-05)
# Note that the first weight is the same as above (by definition it's always
#  exp(-1)), but the second and third are very small because x[96] is
#  very close to x[94].
X95est_allow = sum(weights94_allow * simple_ts[psivec94_allow+1]) /
               sum(weights94_allow)
X95est_allow
```

However, the issue is that we should not be allowed to use $\bf{x}(96)$.
By definition,
$$\bf{x}(96) = (X(96), X(95)),$$
which contains $X(95)$. But $X(95)$ is one of the components of
$$\bf{x}(95) = (X(95), X(94))$$
which is what we are trying to forecast from $\bf{x}(94)$.
$X(95)$ is presumably the 'one' that we are leaving out in 'leave-one-out', but
it occurs in $\bf{x}(95)$ and $\bf{x}(96)$, by definition.

So $\bf{x}(96)$ should not be used to forecast $\bf{x}(95)$, because it
explicitly contains one of the two components of $\bf{x}(95)$.

The Same issue occurs (with Andy's old code) for $t^*=75$.

## Another attempt with `rEDM`

Had tried this in `rEDM`, to not allow $X(96)$ to be a nearest neighbour
predicting $X(95)$ from $X(94)$ -- think this isn't possible, since still kind of
want cross-validation. Had played with `lib` and `pred` but couldn't get answer
to agree with Andy's original one (may be off with the index by 1). Not running
this in vignette:
```{r rEDMagain, eval=FALSE}
simp_Efix2 = simplex(simple_ts,
                     E = 2,
                     stats_only = FALSE,
                     # lib = matrix(c(1, 94, 97, 99), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE),
                     lib = c(1, 94),
                     pred = c(95, 97)
                     # pred = matrix(c(95, 95, 96, 96), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
                     )
rEDM_points2 = simp_Efix2[,"model_output"][[1]]       # time, obs, pred and pred_var
# Make each row correspond to t:
# rEDM_points2 = rbind(c(1, simple_ts[1], NA, NA), rEDM_points2) - only if doing all times
head(rEDM_points2)
```
