```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.height = 6
)
```

```{r setup}
library(pbsEDM)
```

The tibble `Nx_lags_orig` is saved in the package and contains a simple time
series $N(t)$ as `Nt`, the lagged value $N(t-1)$ as `Ntmin1`, and first difference
$X(t) = N(t+1) - N(t)$ as `Xt` (and `Xtmin1` and `Xtmin2` the lagged values),
with EDM results for embedding dimension 2, using `rEDM` and Andy's original
function `EDM_pred_E_2()`. See `?Nx_lags_orig` for full details.

Using that as an example here, see `inclusion_issue.Rmd` vignette for comparison
of Andy's original results with results from `pbsEDM` and `rEDM`.

## Visualise data - can prob skip once new function done

Plot of data (before making movie):
```{r}
plotPanelMovie.df2(Nx_lags_orig,
                   only.final.plot=TRUE,
                   open.pdf=FALSE)
```

Movie -- see `inclusion_issue.Rmd` vignette.

The final panel shows the predicted vs observed from rEDM and from Andy's manual
calculations (not relevant here).

## Analyse with pbsEDM code

```{r pbsEDMcalc}
calc <- pbsEDM(Nx_lags_orig,
               lags = list(Xt = c(0:1))) # A list of results

# pred <- calc$xt_forecast

plot_observed(calc, late.num = 5)
```

```{r calc2}
# Use original Nt only, do lag of 1:
calc2 <- pbsEDM(Nx_lags_orig,
                lags = list(Nt = c(0:1)),
                first_difference = TRUE)

# plot_observed(calc2, late.num = 5)

testthat::expect_equal(calc$xt_forecast, calc2$xt_forecast)
```

Plot time series and cobweb plots

```{r cobweb}
plot(calc2)
```

Movie, with final time point incrementing by one each frame (commented out after
running since gifski causes Travis to fail:

<!-- [Longer explanation from sizeSpectra]: Here is the code to build the movie, but it is commented out since it causes Travis
to fail -- Travis is the continuous integration service that automatically
checks the packages builds every time a change is committed to GitHub, giving the
little green symbol `passing` icon on the main page. The trick to showing the
movie is to run the code uncommented (you need to install the `gifski` package), right-click on the animation in the
html viewer and save it. I've done that and so am leaving this code commented,
and will just refer to the saved animation file.



```{r, eval=FALSE}

```{r, animation.hook = 'gifski', interval = 1.5, fig.width = 5.36, fig.height = 8}
# fig.width is 0.67 * fig.height (which is 8)
#
for(iiii in 1:length(Nx_lags_orig$Nt)){
  plot(calc2,
       last.time.to.plot = iiii)
}

  #    ISD_bin_plot(data.year = data.year.list[[i]],
#                 b.MLE = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year == fullYears[i])$b,
#                 b.confMin = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                      fullYears[i])$confMin,
#                 b.confMax = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                      fullYears[i])$confMax,
#                 year = fullYears[i],
#                 xlim = xlim.global,
#                 xmin = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                      fullYears[i])$xmin,
#                 xmax = dplyr::filter(MLEbins.res, Year ==
#                                                   fullYears[i])$xmax
#                 )
# }

Loop over values of lag (then make into wrapper function):
```{r loop}
E_res = list()
par(mfrow = c(3,2))
for(E in 1:5){
  E_res[[E]] <- pbsEDM(Nx_lags_orig,
                       lags = list(Nt = 0:E),
                       first_difference = TRUE)
#  plot_observed(E_res[[E]], late.num = 5)
}
```
